# Persian-learning-app

This is a Persian learning app, design for personal use. I've been a bit fraustrated over the years with a lack of support for learning particular language on sites like DuoLingo which offer no support for Persian/Farsi.

This is a static html web page, with content extracted from a text book that I own. The reason for this particularly lazy structure is that I want the app to easily work on my Iphone. All of the content is extracted and the webpage built using Gemini 3 Pro. Merci Google!
